# `EOBnsmodes`

We present the EOBnsmodes model here. It is a time-domain gravitational wave (GW) model for binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) systems, constructed within the effective-one-body framework. This model captures the dynamical tide inside the NS, especially the spin angular momentum carried by the tide (the ``tidal spin``) that is typically ignored in other effective Love number-based models. 

The paper describing the model in detail will be posted on arXiv and submitted to a journal soon.
